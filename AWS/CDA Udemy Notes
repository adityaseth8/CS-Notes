Section 1:
AWS Regions (cluster of data centers).
Most AWS services are region-scoped (if we use service in one region, and then try using it in another region, it’ll be like a new time of using the service)
How to choose aws region? Depends on:
Compliance with data governance, legal requirements
Proximity to customers - reduce lag / latency
Available services within a region 
Pricing varies region to region
AWS Availability Zones (AZ) - each region has multiple AZ’s. Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. AZ separate from eachother, isolated from disasters
